# EPA-RATA
The following is an investigation of the historic use of alternate performance specifications (APS) for Relative Accuracy Test Audits (RATA) required under 40 CFR part 75, a statistical calculation of alternate performance specifications, a determination of revised alternate performance specifications, and an evaluation of the effect of the proposed alternate performance specifications on the overall pass/fail rate and frequency (annual/semi-annual) qualification of the historic RATA results.

The following RATA tests will be included in this analysis:

- SO2 and NOX concentration (ppm)
- NOX rate (lb/mmBtu)
- CO2 and O2 (percent)
- Moisture (%H2O)

Files in this repository include the R script (RATA.R), R Notebook (RataAnalysis.RMD), Dashboard script (RATADashboard.R) and it's helper file (helper.R). Raw data is found in the rawdata directory.
